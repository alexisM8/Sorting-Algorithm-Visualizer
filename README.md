# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is a small project I did to practice Javascript. Originally I created a similar sorting algorithm visualizer using [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) and [ImGui-SFML](https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml) in c++, but found I could not easily share my creation with friends and family that aren't so tech savvy.
